# Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a growing area of NLP that aims to accurately locate and classify key information within text.

Here, I provide a walkthrough of building a custom NER model from scratch using the latest version of spaCy v3. 

After annotating and training on a mini dataset, the model is able to identify various types of home improvement and contractor services within unstructured text.

This work can lead to automatically classifying and tagging contractor websites based on the services they provide.
